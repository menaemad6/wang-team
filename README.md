## 📋 Project Description

Water desalination is a crucial process for removing excess salts and minerals from water, making it suitable for human consumption and other uses. Our project addresses the growing global water crisis by developing an efficient and sustainable desalination solution.

Many coastal countries are turning to seawater desalination to meet their water needs due to increasing scarcity of fresh water resources. Our project demonstrates a practical approach to desalination that can be implemented in regions facing water shortages.
